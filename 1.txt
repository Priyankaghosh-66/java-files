Here are the steps to verify the installation of the necessary software to perform Java 7 software development.
tasks:
1. Open a command or terminal window.
2. Execute the java -version command. This verifies that a JRE is installed ; this does not verify that the JDK is installed.
a. Verify that the output of the java -version command matches the following example output. For 64-bit machines, the output should be:
java version "1 . 7 . 0"
java (TM) SE Runtime
Enviorment (build 1 . 7 . 0-b147)
Java HotSpot (TM) 64-bit
server VM (build 21. 0-b17, mixed mode)
For 32-bit machines, the output should be:
java version "1 . 7 . 0"
Java (TM) SE runtime
Enviorment ( built 1 . 7 . 0-b147)
Java HotSpot (TM) Client VM
(build 21.0-b17, mixed mode, sharing)
b. if a different version number or an error message is displayed, you may have one of the following possible problems:
* The JRE/JDK is not installed.
* The java command is not in your path.
*The wrong JRE/JDK version installed.
* MUltiple JREs/JDKs are installed
3. Execute the javac -version command. This verifies that a JDK is installed.
a. Verify that the output of the javac -version command matches the following example output:
javac 1 . 7 . 0
b. If a different version number or an error message is displayed, you may have one of the following possible problems:
* The JDK is not installed.
* The javac cdommand is not in your path.
* The wrong JDK version isd installed.
* Multiple JDK s are installed.
4. Start the Netbeans IDE and verify the version number of the JDK used by the IDE.
a. The installed of NetBeans places a menu in your start menu. Locate the NetBeans IDE 7.0.1 shortcut within the start menu and click it.
b. within NET beans, click the Help menu, and then click About.
c. The About dialog box displays both the NetBeans and JDK version numbers that are being used. For 64-bit machines, you should see:
Product Version: NetBeans IDE 7.0.1 (Build 201107282000)
JAVA: 1.7.0; Java HotSpot (TM) 64-bit Server VM 21.0-b17
For 32-bit machines, you should see: Product Version: NETbeans IDE 7.0.1 (Built 201107282000)
Java: 1.7.0; Java HotSpot (TM) Client VM 21.0-b17
d. Click the close button to close the About dialog box
